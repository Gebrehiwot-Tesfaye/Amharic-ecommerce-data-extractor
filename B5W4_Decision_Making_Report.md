# B5W4: Decision-Making Report

**Program:** 10 Academy – Artificial Intelligence Mastery  
**Week 4:** Decision-Making Using Bezos' Framework

## Introduction

As I navigate the 10 Academy journey and prepare for a career in data-driven innovation, I recognize that decision-making is a skill that underpins success. To make high-impact choices, I've adopted Jeff Bezos' strategic decision-making framework. This framework distinguishes between irreversible, strategic decisions (Type 1) and reversible, experimental decisions (Type 2), guiding me to allocate time and focus effectively.

This report applies that framework to two professional dilemmas, providing detailed classifications, structured analysis, and reasoned recommendations.

## Scenario 1: Cloud Platform Decision for a Fintech Startup

**Decision Type:** Type 1

**Justification:**
This is a strategic, high-impact, and long-term decision. The chosen cloud platform will directly influence the startup's scalability, performance, cost efficiency, and attractiveness to investors. Since migrating platforms in the future can be costly, complex, and risky (especially with proprietary APIs and tools), this decision is not easily reversible, classifying it as Type 1.

### Decision-Making Process

**Available Options:**

| Platform                    | Pros                                                                                                                                                                | Cons                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS (Amazon Web Services)   | - Market leader with wide adoption.<br>- Strong global presence and ecosystem.<br>- Trusted by investors.<br>- Flexible pricing and advanced ML/analytics services. | - Slightly more expensive than others.<br>- Complex pricing structure.<br>- May require deeper technical expertise.         |
| Google Cloud Platform (GCP) | - Excellent for AI/ML workloads.<br>- Strong data services (BigQuery, TensorFlow).<br>- Competitive pricing.<br>- Integration with Firebase (mobile-centric).       | - Smaller market share.<br>- Less enterprise adoption in Africa.<br>- Fewer investors use GCP as a standard.                |
| Microsoft Azure             | - Strong hybrid cloud solutions.<br>- Popular with governments and enterprises.<br>- Broad developer tool integration (e.g., GitHub, VS Code).                      | - Steeper learning curve.<br>- Slightly weaker startup/investor ecosystem.<br>- Less usage in mobile-first African markets. |

**Final Decision:** **AWS**

**Rationale:**
Given our startup's ambition to attract investors and scale within 5 years, AWS is the best fit. It is the most trusted platform among VCs, has broadest global support, and offers a full suite of AI, storage, and compute services tailored for fintech needs. While slightly costlier, the value in reliability, scalability, and investor confidence outweighs the extra cost. AWS also has established training programs and startup credits that can offset early-stage costs.

## Scenario 2: IoT Expansion at GreenFarms

**Decision Type:** Type 1

**Justification:**
This is a strategic investment that affects company direction, talent acquisition, and resource allocation. The outcome could shift the organization's long-term capabilities and impact customer offerings. It is not easily reversible once executed, especially if a new hire is brought in. Therefore, this is a Type 1 decision.

### Decision-Making Process

**Available Options:**

| Option                       | Pros                                                                                                                 | Cons                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A: Hire a new IoT expert     | - Immediate technical capability.<br>- Fast execution of the vision.<br>- Innovation through fresh perspective.      | - High salary expectations.<br>- Risk if the new hire does not align culturally.<br>- Budget constraints could strain other initiatives. |
| B: Upskill the existing team | - Cost-effective and motivational for staff.<br>- Leverages internal knowledge.<br>- Builds long-term team capacity. | - Slower implementation.<br>- Temporary productivity drop.<br>- May still lack deep IoT expertise.                                       |

**Final Decision:** **Option B – Upskill the Existing Team**

**Rationale:**
While hiring an expert provides immediate technical capacity, the financial strain and cultural risk outweigh the speed benefit. By investing in training the existing team, the company builds sustainable internal capability, which supports innovation beyond this project. This also promotes employee retention and morale, as staff are empowered to grow and lead. With careful planning (e.g., phased rollouts, part-time external consultants), the longer timeline can be managed effectively.

## Usefulness in Real Life

Strategic decision-making is foundational for both professional growth and organizational success. By identifying whether a decision is reversible (Type 2) or irreversible (Type 1), I've learned how to:

- Slow down for big bets and move quickly on iterative actions.
- Evaluate trade-offs transparently and methodically.
- Align choices with strategic goals, such as investment-readiness or capacity-building.
- Navigate resource constraints without compromising innovation.

These skills extend into my personal life, where thoughtful planning and clarity of consequences lead to better relationships, productivity, and well-being.

## Conclusion

Using Jeff Bezos' decision-making framework has allowed me to approach complex dilemmas with clarity and confidence. Whether choosing a scalable cloud infrastructure or planning how to deliver cutting-edge IoT solutions on a budget, the process of classifying, analyzing, and justifying decisions has prepared me for future leadership roles. This method will remain a cornerstone of how I evaluate challenges in my evolving professional journey.
