## **Business Need and Overview**

### **EthioMart Vision and Problem Statement**

EthioMart has a vision to become the primary hub for all Telegram-based e-commerce activities in Ethiopia. With the increasing popularity of Telegram for business transactions, various independent e-commerce channels have emerged, each facilitating its own operations. However, this decentralization presents challenges for both vendors and customers who need to manage multiple channels for product discovery, order placement, and communication.

To solve this problem, EthioMart plans to create a single centralized platform that consolidates real-time data from multiple e-commerce Telegram channels into one unified channel. By doing this, they aim to provide a seamless experience for customers to explore and interact with multiple vendors in one place.

### **Project Objectives**

This project focuses on fine-tuning LLM's for Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that extracts key business entities such as product names, prices, and locations, from text, images, and documents shared across Telegram channels. The extracted data will be used to populate EthioMart's centralized database, making it a comprehensive e-commerce hub.

**Key Objectives:**

1. Develop a repeatable workflow that begins with data ingestion from Telegram channels, proceeds through preprocessing and labeling, and results in structured, machine-readable data.
2. Fine-tune a transformer-based model to achieve high accuracy (measured by F1-score) in identifying Product, Price, and Location entities within unstructured Amharic text.
3. Go beyond just building a model by comparing multiple approaches, interpreting model predictions with tools like SHAP/LIME, and delivering a final analysis that recommends the best model for EthioMart's business case.

### **Target Entities**

**Primary Entities:**

- **Product Names or Types**: Specific product identifiers and categories
- **Material or Ingredients**: Specific mentions of materials used in the products
- **Location Mentions**: Geographic locations and addresses
- **Monetary Values or Prices**: Product pricing information

**Optional Entities:**

- **DELIVERY_FEE**: To capture transaction costs beyond the product price
  - Examples: "free delivery", "150 birr delivery fee", "delivery cost extra"
- **CONTACT_INFO**: To capture the means of completing a transaction
  - Examples: Phone numbers (09...), Telegram usernames (@username)
