# Task 6: Vendor Scorecard for Micro-Lending

## Introduction

As part of EthioMart's mission to empower Ethiopian e-commerce vendors, I developed a Vendor Analytics Engine to identify the most active and promising vendors for micro-lending opportunities. By combining NER-extracted business entities with Telegram post metadata, I created a comprehensive scorecard to assess each vendor's business activity and customer engagement.

**Channels analyzed:**

- helloomarketethiopia
- HuluMar
- guzomart
- gareeodaa
- huluorder

---

## Methodology

For each vendor/channel, I calculated the following key metrics:

- **Posting Frequency:** Average number of posts per week (activity & consistency)
- **Average Views per Post:** Indicator of market reach and engagement
- **Top Performing Post:** The post with the highest view count, including its product and price (from NER)
- **Average Price Point:** The average price of products listed (business profile)
- **Lending Score:** A composite score combining engagement and activity

**Lending Score Formula:**

```
Lending Score = (Avg. Views/Post × 0.5) + (Posts/Week × 0.5)
```

## Insights

- **Most Active Vendor:** helloomarketethiopia leads in both posting frequency and average views, making it the top candidate for micro-lending.
- **Market Reach:** Vendors with higher average views per post (e.g., helloomarketethiopia, HuluMar) demonstrate stronger customer engagement.
- **Business Profile:** Average price points suggest a mix of high-volume/low-margin and low-volume/high-margin sellers across channels.
- **Top Products:** The best-performing posts often feature popular or high-value products, indicating what resonates with customers.

---

## Recommendations

- **Lending Prioritization:** Use the Lending Score to shortlist vendors for micro-lending offers, focusing on those with high engagement and consistent activity.
- **Monitor Trends:** Regularly update the scorecard to reflect changes in vendor activity and engagement.
- **Expand Metrics:** Consider including additional factors such as customer feedback, delivery reliability, and product diversity in future analyses.
- **Support Growth:** Offer business development resources to vendors with high potential but lower current engagement to help them scale.

## Conclusion

The Vendor Scorecard provides a data-driven foundation for EthioMart's micro-lending strategy. By leveraging both NER-extracted business entities and real engagement metrics, we can identify and support the vendors most likely to succeed and grow within Ethiopia's dynamic e-commerce ecosystem.
